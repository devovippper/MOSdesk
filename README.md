# MOSdesk

MOSdesk is a user-space desktop environment for [Minimal-OS](https://github.com/fsminecrafter/Minimal-OS). It renders the desktop as layered ARGB8888 surfaces, tracks dirty regions for efficient redraws, and exposes reusable text-rendering libraries for other Minimal-OS programs.

The project is split into a desktop implementation, the Minimal-OS SDK toolchain, and the underlying OS sources used to build and package the system.

## Features

- Composites desktop layers and window surfaces with dirty-rectangle updates
- Renders smooth, anti-aliased OpenType/TrueType text (Inter, bundled) through the reusable `ttrend` / `ttrend_outline` libraries, with the bitmap font as a fallback
- Produces SDK `.slib` bundles that can be consumed by other freestanding programs
- Packages the desktop as a Minimal-OS deliver package (`.mpkg`) for installation

## Repository layout

- `mosdesk/` — MOSdesk Settings client, reusable file-type icon library, preview, and packaging metadata
- `mosWM/` — the MOSdesk desktop, compositor, cursor, and protected application window API
- `Minimal-OS-SDK/` — toolchain and build utilities for freestanding C/C++ programs and `.slib` bundles
- `Minimal-OS/` — Minimal-OS source tree used by the SDK and runtime
- `msdk` — convenience wrapper for invoking the SDK toolchain

## Prerequisites

Before building MOSdesk, initialize the SDK and OS submodules and install the required toolchain:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd Minimal-OS-SDK
./install-toolchain.sh
./install.sh
```

Then reload your shell or source your profile so `MSDK`/`msdk` are available on `PATH`.

For more details about the SDK, see [Minimal-OS-SDK/README.md](Minimal-OS-SDK/README.md).

## Build MOSdesk

From the repository root:

```sh
./mosdesk/build.sh
```

The build creates the MOSdesk Settings window client, exported text-rendering
libraries, and the required mosWM desktop shell. It produces
`mosdesk/dist/mosdesk.mpkg` and `mosWM/dist/mosWM.mpkg`.

## Icons

MOSdesk ships a 16-icon, 64x64 pixel-art set (folder, drive, document, PDF,
image, audio, video, code, archive, settings, network, pointer, home,
computer, appearance, mouse). The art is defined in
`mosdesk/tools/icons/icons.py` and compiled into `mosWM/file_icon_data.h`
(palette + run-length encoded, ~20 KB). `moswm_draw_file_icon_sized()` draws any
size; 64 is pixel-perfect and other sizes are area-averaged.

```sh
python3 mosdesk/tools/icons/generate_icons.py   # regenerates the header, the
                                                # SVG sprite and icons/pixel/*.png
```

## Cursor showcase

```sh
./mosdesk/tools/host_preview/cursors.sh [outdir]
```

Builds the real mosWM cursor loader on the host and writes
`posy_cursor_states.png` (all 14 states), `posy_cursor_in_context.png`
(real compositor frames), `posy_cursor_animated.gif` (busy / working) and
`posy_cursor_source_128.png` (the 128 px source art). Needs gcc and Pillow.

## Preview MOSdesk

To view the desktop layout in a browser without building or booting Minimal-OS:

```sh
./mosdesk/preview.sh
```

Open `/mosdesk/preview.html` on port 8000 in the Codespaces Ports panel. This
browser preview recreates the desktop appearance; it does not run the
Minimal-OS executable.

## Build mosWM

`mosWM` is the desktop shell and window manager. Build its desktop package with:

```sh
./mosWM/build.sh
```

This produces `mosWM/dist/mosWM.run` and the installable
`mosWM/dist/mosWM.mpkg`. Installing the package places its executable, default
cursor, and `mosWM.service` module definition in the OS. The service starts the
desktop after the boot disk is mounted. MOSdesk Settings is opened from the
Start menu and saves desktop preferences for future sessions. Its default
pointer is the Posy cursor pack; the previous single-pointer cursor is
available as Classic. Attribution is included in the package.

On the first MOSdesk launch, mosWM creates `0:/users/` and shows a one-time
setup asking whether to enable password sign-in. Choosing no enables automatic
sign-in; choosing yes sets the desktop password. Password sign-in is a
MOSdesk desktop gate, not an OS-level account or filesystem security boundary.
Settings includes Appearance (accent and wallpaper), Mouse, Cursor, and Login
pages.

The standalone manager can also be started manually from the Minimal-OS
terminal:

```text
run 0:/programs/mosWM/mosWM.run
```

The OS service manager starts the registered desktop as a supervised user
process. If the program or service definition is absent, service discovery
skips it and the built-in terminal remains available. Applications can use the
SDK's [`window.h`](Minimal-OS-SDK/include/window.h)
API to create and manage their own windows. Kernel-enforced ownership prevents
unrelated applications from accessing window state, input events, or frame
buffers. See [mosWM/README.md](mosWM/README.md) for the API and behavior.

## Build artifacts

After a successful build, the following files are produced in `mosdesk/dist/`:

- `mosdesk.run` — the desktop executable
- `ttrend_raster.slib` — raster text renderer library bundle
- `ttrend_outline.slib` — OpenType/TrueType (CFF and glyf) anti-aliased text renderer bundle
- `mosdesk.mpkg` — deliver package for Minimal-OS installation
- `mosdesk/` — unpacked package directory used to assemble the final package

The `.slib` bundles are distribution artifacts for Minimal-OS. The runtime does not currently load shared libraries dynamically at runtime; instead, they are used as packaged SDK deliverables and metadata for other programs.

## Smooth text

`ttrend_outline` parses `.otf`/`.ttf` fonts in memory and rasterises glyphs with
exact-area coverage in integer fixed point (no floating point, no libm, no
malloc while drawing), 1/4-pixel glyph positioning and a small coverage cache.
`ttrend_font_load_path()` now accepts outline fonts too; `ttrend_font_is_vector()`
tells which kind was loaded. mosWM and MOSdesk Settings load `Inter-Regular.otf`
and `Inter-Medium.otf` (Latin subsets, SIL OFL 1.1, see `Inter-LICENSE.txt`) and
fall back to the bitmap font if the files are missing. Not implemented: hinting,
kerning/GPOS, CID-keyed CFF and variable fonts.

Host tests (no SDK needed):

```sh
cc -I mosdesk/libraries/ttrend_outline/include \
   mosdesk/libraries/ttrend_outline/tests/outline_render_test.c \
   mosdesk/libraries/ttrend_outline/src/ttrend_outline.c -o /tmp/outline_test
/tmp/outline_test mosdesk/fonts/Inter-Regular.otf /tmp/preview.ppm
```

## Notes

MOSdesk is designed to run as a user-space component within Minimal-OS rather than as a traditional desktop environment on a host OS. The build process expects the Minimal-OS SDK and supporting OS infrastructure to be present in the repository checkout.
